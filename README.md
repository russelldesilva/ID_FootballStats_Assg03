# ID_FootballStats_Assg03
If you are a football fan, you would be familiar with waking up on weekends and spending the morning looking up results of the previous night's games. You might also be familiar with researching player statistics for your fantasy team, or even Googling the lastest transfers. All this can be quite time consuming and frustrating, which is why we have come up with an interactive website that allows you to satisfy your football needs in just a few clicks. Our website can display the latest scores, standings and statistics across all major competitions across the world, making it the one-stop place for all things football.

## Design Process
 
This website is meant for football/soccer fans to check on their favourite teams and players without having to visit various different websites.

User stories:
- As a football fan, I would like to see the league tables of any league I choose so that I can check on my favourite teams
- As a football fan, I would like to find out different statistics about players so that I can see how well they are performing
- As a football fan, I would like to see the lastest results of matches I might have missed so that I can find out how well my team is doing
